## Responsive Portfolio Using Bootstrap components

## Description

Moving into week 2 of the monash bootcamp full stack web development course we were given the challenge of creating a responsive website utilising bootstrap, media queries and css to style everything into a nice complete website that both functions and looks appealing.  Starting out a little unfamiliar with bootstrap and the complexities that happen from utilising code that is not entirely your own were quickly apparent. This leads nicely into the next section.

## Difficulties 


Starting off utilising bootstrap to such an extent was a challenge i was looking forward to, though it was easy to get a little lost and quite frustrated when i didn't know entirely what made a piece of code function or look a specific way, it slowly became clearer as i muddled my way through, some things that i struggled with particularly were

Aligning items to other containers of differing widths or heights
The appearance of images being treated as links 
Getting my page to look a particular way in all browser sizes and getting it to behave properly 

Though these things were new to me, as I started to unlock the secrets of each new piece of code, my eleation grew. I was getting closer to my goal of understanding and applying that knowledge correctly.


## Features

Index.html  page features an about me section sections into rows and columns with multiple breakpoints to change column widths at certain screen sizes to keep the page looking good but remaining functional 

Contact.html features a 4 forms and a no resizable text box for uses to enter info into along with a submit button that at this point of time resets the fields rather than submits the data. 

portfolio.html  features 6 imgâ€™s current 3 of projects ive worked on and 3 placeholder images for future projects as the weeks progress. The images remain static in size but reshuffle as the screen shrinks to keep an even flow and look.
